# Charting-Library---Android-SDK
Native Android SDK for the [ChartIQ JavaScript Library](https://documentation.chartiq.com).

This SDK has been designed to support a [basic application](https://github.com/ChartIQ/Charting-Library---Android-Sample-App) and may need to be extended to support more elaborate implementations. This can be done by adding additional code to invoke Javascript functions directly. Feel free to contact us and request sample code and guidance on how to extend the SDK.

## Requirements

- Version 7.0.5 to 7.5.0 of the ChartIQ library. Support for version 8.0.0 coming soon.

  Please contact info@cosaic.io if you do not already have a license or evaluation version of the library.

## Sample app

A sample app using this SDK can be found here: https://github.com/ChartIQ/Charting-Library---Android-Sample-App
